# Evelyn Chinchankar Portfolio

## Who am I?
Hey there! I'm Evelyn Chinchankar, a junior at Westchester Academy for International Studies in Houston, Texas. I am currently in my third year of programming and in pursuit of an IB diploma. Over my three years with coding, I've worked with Python, javascript, HTML, CSS & PHP. 

## How does this portfolio work?
Over my high school career, I've compiled my computer science work here on GitHub. My Free Coding section is work I've done outside of school or not directly for a computer science class. After that, all my work is divided by the scholastic year I made it. Enjoy!

### eHackathon
Over the summer of 2020, I participated in my first ever hackathon! The prompt was to create any product involving disaster reflief. I worked alongside three other girls in an attempt to help people struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We created an HTML website with a JavaScript map (using the Leaflet library) that locates resources relevant to the pandemic for Houstonians. For example, we mapped grocery stores offering senior hours or pharmacies with COVID testing. After spending a relentless weekend making our product, we won the hackathon. Our DevPost submission and the actual website are linked here.
