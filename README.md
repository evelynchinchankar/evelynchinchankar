# Portfolio

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Evelyn Chinchankar, a junior at Westchester Academy for International Studies in Houston, Texas. I am currently in my third year of programming and in pursuit of an IB diploma. Over my three years with coding, I've worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS & PHP. 

## How does this portfolio work?
Over my high school career, I've compiled my computer science work here on GitHub. My Free Coding section is work I've done outside of school or not directly for a computer science class. After that, all my work is divided by the scholastic year I made it. Enjoy!

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to email me @ evelynchinchankar@gmail.com !

### eHackathon
Over the summer of 2020, I participated in my first ever hackathon! The prompt was to create any product involving disaster reflief. I worked alongside three other girls in an attempt to help people struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We created an HTML website with a JavaScript map that locates resources relevant to the pandemic for Houstonians. For example, we mapped grocery stores offering senior hours or pharmacies with COVID testing. After spending a relentless weekend making our product, we finished in first place! Our DevPost submission and the actual product are linked here.

### Personal Project
As an IB student, one requirement is that we complete a personal project over our freshman and sophomore years of high school. The personal project is an open project where students create something related to one of their interests. As an avid computer scientist, I chose to make an HTML website (with JavaScript and CSS) teaching basic Python. I do not have the file for my work, however, the attached video shows my final product. Since it is a large file, you may have to download it.

## IB Computer Science (2020-2022)
### Hypothetical Case Study
Our latest unit has focused more on system fundamentals and IT policy. The project for our unit was to create a randomly determined company and act as a process analyst to yet another randomly determined company facing an issue. I "worked" as a part of ProcessEase to help the Crochet Chinthe Cafe on Mars to compete with another cafe domnating the market. I proposed my solutions in the Google Slides presentation linked below.

This project tested my knowledge on system management, system implementation, and process management. 

### PHP Single-Serving Site Project
To begin IB Computer Science, we've started looking at PHP. I am currently (10/15/20) working on our first big project of the year. Over a few classes, I completed a Lynda course called Single Serving Sites. My project is coming along in the index.html file while my notes from the course are across other files. Please note that most of the notes are directly from the video. Also, note that this is a work in progress and my project is not yet complete.

## Computer Science 2 (2019-2020)
In Computer Science 2, we focused on JavaScript. All my work can be accessed as follows:
To run my programs, first open the _hello.html_ file or first _.html_ file. 
In this file, there is a line with "FILE_NAME_HERE"
Replace those words with whichever JavaScript file you'd like to open.
Download the JavaScript file and then run the _hello.html_ file.

Unfortuantely, I do not have any work from the fourth quartile. This is due to the abrupt school shutdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Computer Science 1 (2018-2019)
I have been unable to add Computer Science 1 projects to my updated portfolio. This is because I have not had access to school computers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The work will be uploaded as soon as possible.
