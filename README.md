# Portfolio

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Evelyn Chinchankar, a sophomore at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin studying biomedical engineering, with a keen interest in computer science. I am currently in my sixth year of programming and am in the process of obtaining an Elements of Computing Certificate from UT. Over my years coding, I've worked with Python, JavaScript, C++, MATLAB, HTML, CSS & PHP. 

## How does this portfolio work?
Throughout high school, I compiled my computer science work here on GitHub, both to highlight my work and demonstrate my development within computer science. My Free Coding section is work I did outside of school or not directly for a computer science class. After that, all my work is divided by the scholastic year I made it. Enjoy!

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to email me @ evelynchinchankar@gmail.com !

## Free Coding
### eHackathon
Over the summer of 2020, I participated in my first ever hackathon! The prompt was to create any product involving disaster reflief. I worked alongside three other girls in an attempt to help people struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We created an HTML website with a JavaScript map that locates resources relevant to the pandemic for Houstonians. For example, we mapped grocery stores offering senior hours or pharmacies with COVID testing. After spending a relentless weekend making our product, we finished in first place! Our DevPost submission and the actual product are linked here.

### Personal Project
As an IB student, one requirement is that we complete a personal project over our freshman and sophomore years of high school. The personal project is an open project where students create something related to one of their interests. As an avid computer scientist, I chose to make an HTML website (with JavaScript and CSS) teaching basic Python. I do not have the file for my work, however, the attached video shows my final product. Since it is a large file, you may have to download it.

## IB Computer Science (2020-2022)
### IB DP CS Year 2
Our focus was on programming fundamentals using C and Python in order to develop an Internal Assesment for the IB Diploma Exam. 

### IB DP CS Year 1

### Hypothetical Case Study
Our last unit in DP CS Year 1 focused on system fundamentals and IT policy. The project for our unit was to create a randomly determined company and act as a process analyst to yet another randomly determined company facing an issue. I "worked" as a part of ProcessEase to help the Crochet Chinthe Cafe on Mars to compete with another cafe dominating the market. I proposed my solutions in the Google Slides presentation linked below.

This project tested my knowledge on system management, system implementation, and process management. In order to save the cafe, I had to propose a new system, which then involved how that system would actually be used within the company. I also had to address other aspects, like advertising and investments, to help the business further. This project helped me develop a better understanding of how system fundamentals are involved in the real world, as well as how to apply my knowledge to real-world issues to create real-world solutions. 

### PHP Single-Serving Site Project
To begin IB Computer Science, we've started looking at PHP. Over a few classes, I completed a Lynda course called Single Serving Sites. My project is coming along in the index.html file while my notes from the course span across other files. Please note that most of the notes are directly from the video. Additionally, this is a project still in progress.

### OTHER
Towards the end of year, we learned more about computer fundamentals. To demonstrate the knowledge, I have signifcantly begun various LinkedIn Learning Courses that will award certificates upon their completion. My in-progress courses include:

CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep: 1 Understanding Networks

CompTIA A+ (220-1001) Cert Prep 2: Microprocessing and RAM

## Computer Science 2 (2019-2020)
In Computer Science 2, we focused on JavaScript. All my work can be accessed as follows:
To run my programs, first open the _hello.html_ file or first _.html_ file. 
In this file, there is a line with "FILE_NAME_HERE"
Replace those words with whichever JavaScript file you'd like to open.
Download the JavaScript file and then run the _hello.html_ file.

Unfortunately, I do not have any work from the fourth quartile. This is due to the abrupt school shutdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Computer Science 1 (2018-2019)
I have been unable to add Computer Science 1 projects to my updated portfolio. This is because I have not had access to school computers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The work will be uploaded as soon as possible.
